# Accessibility-Friendly-Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was knowing that I'd improve on my HTML and CSS knowledge by refactoing. The reason behind this was to make the website more accessible and optimized for search engines. This solves having DRY code and making the code more readible and organized. I learned semantic HTML. I changed the <div> for <header> <nav> <main> <aside> <footer> tags. I also changed some class attributes for id attributes.
